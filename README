puzzle+
By Dan Vanderkam
Based on "lmnopuz", by Evan Martin and Dan Erat

puzzle+ is a crossword puzzle application for Google+ Hangouts. It allows
collaborative solving of crosswords (i.e. puz files) in G+. The hangout provides
videoconferencing to go along with the puzzle-solving.

To run locally:
1. Install node.js
2. Run:

   npm install
   ./node_modules/.bin/lonely.js --single wave/lmnowave.xml

   Or:

   ./node_modules/.bin/lonely.js wave/lmnowave.xml

3. Visit http://localhost:8080/


At this point, you have a standard save-reload iteration cycle.
If you didn't pass in "--single" on the command line, you can open
http://localhost:8080/ in multiple tabs (or multiple browsers) to test
multiplayer situations.


To publish an update to "production", run:

    appcfg update .
    cp wave/*.xml ../danvk.github.io/lmnowave/

And then push the changes to danvk.org. The AppEngine app is used to get SSL.


The state object looks like this:

```javascript
{
  "crossword": "...",         // (bytes of the .puz file)
  "@rgb(178,255,178)": 1234,  // @ + color -> player ID
  "c1234": "4,2",             // c + player ID -> cursor position
  "1,2":"O\t1234",            // (x, y) -> "Answer<tab>Player ID"
  "2,2":"R\t1234",
  "3,2":"T\t1234",
  ...,
  "g1,1,x": "",             // wrong guesses
  "g3,4,y": "",
  ...,
  "v,check,(type),(player_id)": "",  // pending votes
  ...
}
```


A bit of lmnowave history:

2007-2008
derat and emartin create lmnopuz, with a JS frontend and a Ruby backend.
The service works, but there's no good place to host it.

2009
After learning about Wave, danvk remembers lmnopuz and writes the code to store
crossword state in a wave. Work is abandoned after the realization that there's
no way to access uploaded files via JavaScript, a crucial feature of lmnowave.

2010
After going on a hike with another developer, danvk learns that Firefox 3.6 has
added support for the HTML5 File API. lmnowave is now possible! Hacking
resumes!

2011
Wave is canceled, but the Wave Gadgets API (and hence "lmnowave") lives on as
"Google Shared Spaces".

2012 
Google Shared Spaces is killed/morphed into the Google+ Hangouts API. lmnowave
is rebranded as "puzzle+" and re-released. Lonely Hangouts is also developed
and released to speed up iteration on multiplayer scenarios.
