lmnowave
By Dan Vanderkam
Based on "lmnopuz", by Evan Martin and Dan Erat

lmnowave is a crossword puzzle gadget for Google Wave. It allows collaborative
solving of crosswords in Wave, as well as uploading of Across Lite format
(".puz") files to the wave.

To test wave-related code, you'll need to copy everything in the "wave"
directory to a server that can be accessed by Wave (i.e. not localhost) and
create a gadget whose URL is your copy of the lmnowave.xml file.

To test non-wave related code (i.e. the crossword UI), open localtest/test.html
in your browser. This is much more convenient for debugging that going through
Wave.

A bit of lmnowave history:

2007-2008
derat and emartin create lmnopuz, with a JS frontend and a Ruby backend.
The service works, but there's no good place to host it.

2009
After learning about Wave, danvk remembers lmnopuz and writes the code to store
crossword state in a wave. Work is abandoned after the realization that there's
no way to access uploaded files via JavaScript, a crucial feature of lmnowave.

2010
After going on a hike with another developer, danvk learns that Firefox 3.6 has
added support for the HTML5 File API. lmnowave is now possible! Hacking
resumes!
