- (danvk) some people object to not overwriting.

- (danvk) Make the "highlight" color something distinct from anyone's answer
  color. Currently it appears as though you "own" the highlighted answer.

- (danvk) Show other players' cursors (store in wave state).

- (danvk) circled letters, e.g. in
  http://rexwordpuzzle.blogspot.com/2010/03/former-captial-of-crete-thu-3-11-10.html

- (danvk) Figure out a way to source from the current server.
  Currently always sources from danvk.org.

- (derat) Write an lmnowave robot
  Automatically linkify clue references in the wave.
  Notify when puzzle is complete
  Fill in answers when someone says "I give up"?

- Add back keyboard shortcuts like "?". (if possible)

- A way to check errors/reveal answers

- Type a number to go to that clue.

- Deal w/ incorrect answer stealing
  imagine A has typed in CORRECT and B comes over and types in MYGUESS; then
  once they realize that CORRECT was correct, B will get credit for all of
  that except the E.  (maybe we could track for each cell who was the first
  to get it right?)
