- (danvk) Assign colors when a user first types a letter. This will result in
  fewer users (and hence more distinctive colors), and will also reduce the
  chance of color conflicts.

- (danvk) Make the "highlight" color something distinct from anyone's answer
  color. Currently it appears as though you "own" the highlighted answer.

- (danvk) Add a big box with the current clue at the top.

- (danvk) Add ESC+type for multiletter answers (e.g. for rebus puzzles).

- (danvk) Figure out a way to source from the current server.
  Currently always sources from danvk.org.

- (danvk) Show the title/author/copyright somewhere.

- (derat) Write an lmnowave robot
  Automatically linkify clue references in the wave.
  Notify when puzzle is complete
  Fill in answers when someone says "I give up"?

- Switch to a standard library for event-handling code
  There's lots of weirdness re: onkeypress vs. onkeydown, arrow keys, Safari, etc.
  This code from closure is what we should be using:
  http://doctype.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/goog/events/keyhandler.js
  Or: get Julie or Ojan to fix this =)

- (danvk) Replace the lmnopuz console
  Should be able to use the firebug console in both FF and Chrome.

- Add back keyboard shortcuts like "?". (if possible)

- Show other players' cursors (store in wave state).

- A way to check errors/reveal answers

- End game
  Announce when the puzzle is complete.
  Make it immutable when completed correctly.
  Show colors at the end.

- Type a number to go to that clue.

- Some way to automatically get a new wave w/ a new puzzle each day.

- Deal w/ incorrect answer stealing
  imagine A has typed in CORRECT and B comes over and types in MYGUESS; then
  once they realize that CORRECT was correct, B will get credit for all of
  that except the E.  (maybe we could track for each cell who was the first
  to get it right?)
